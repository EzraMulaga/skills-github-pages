# Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds üêæ

Welcome to my "Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds" project, a project I completed as part of my studies on deep learning and transfer learning through Udacity and AWS. In this project, I leveraged a pre-trained neural network model to classify images of dogs into various breeds with high accuracy. Proudly sharing this achievement with the community!

## Project Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate how to use transfer learning by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to perform a specific classification task: identifying the breed of a dog from an image. By using a pre-trained model, we are able to benefit from the high-quality feature extraction learned on large datasets, thus requiring less computational power and training time.

## Key Highlights ‚ú®

- **Objective**: Build and evaluate a classifier that can identify various dog breeds from images.
- **Tools & Technologies**: AWS, Jupyter Notebook, Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV.
- **Dataset**: The model was fine-tuned on a subset of labeled dog images.
- **Model**: We used transfer learning, specifically a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), to achieve reliable predictions.
  
## Project Details

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded images of dogs and prepared the data using OpenCV and other libraries.
   - Applied data augmentation techniques to enhance the generalization capability of the model.
  
2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Used a pre-trained CNN model such as **ResNet50**, **VGG16**, or **InceptionV3**.
   - Fine-tuned the model by training only the top layers specific to the dog breed classification task.
  
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Used metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate model performance.
   - The model achieved an accuracy of **XX%** on the test set, validating its ability to correctly identify dog breeds.
  
## Results üèÜ

The final model demonstrated high accuracy in identifying the breed of a dog from an image, effectively showcasing the power of transfer learning in image classification tasks. By leveraging pre-trained models, we were able to create a robust classifier with a relatively small amount of data.

## Conclusion

This project underscored the practical value of using pre-trained models for specialized tasks, like classifying dog breeds, without needing extensive training data or computational resources. It‚Äôs a great example of how deep learning and transfer learning can be applied to solve real-world problems.
